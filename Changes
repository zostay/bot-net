Revision history for Perl module Bot::Net

0.0.2 Wed Oct 10 8:24:23 2007
    * Improved Bot::Net::Script::Net to create the log4perl.conf correctly.
    * Refactored Bot::Net::Script::Bot to create new bots rather than run them
      which is taken care of by Bot::Net::Script::Run.
    * Fixed Bot::Net::Script::Net so that it creates "t" directories in new bot
      net applications.
    * Improved Bot::Net::Bot to push Bot::Net::Object onto the caller's @ISA
      during import.
    * Split Bot::Net::Server into two modules: Bot::Net::Server and
      Bot::Net::Mixin::Server::IRC, so it now more closely resembles the
      relationship between Bot::Net::Bot and Bot::Net::Mixin::Bot::IRC.
    * Added a new net.yml setting: ApplicationName
    * Added a new set of states for handling graceful quits for bots and
      servers via the "on bot quit" and "on bot server" states.
    * Added better handling of total shutdown for bots and servers via the new
      "on bot shutdown" and "on server shutdown" states.
    * Added a default_configuration() method to allow mixins to help build a
      generic base configuration for new bots and test bots.
    * Added the ability to store the configuration in a package variable named
      $CONFIG as an alternative to a YAML configuration file.
    * Added Bot::Net::Test for helping built bot net application tests.
    * Added a t/TestNet/t/count.t test to the framework.
    * Some other clean-up, documentation updates, and minor fixes as well.

0.0.1 Sun Oct 7 20:07:47 2007
    * Initial release of Bot::Net.
    * This is a refactoring of a tool I used internally to build a nice bot net
      for synchronization. It still has some left overs from the old country
      that need to be brought into the new system fully, but the new system
      works and is superior to the old one.
    * Bot::Net class as the central singleton.
    * Bot::Net::Bot class as the main mixin implementation for building bots.
    * Bot::Net::Config class to load and find configuration files.
    * Bot::Net::Log class to handle loging via Log::Log4perl
    * Bot::Net::Message class for encapsulating bot messages.
    * Bot::Net::Mixin::Bot::IRC class for making IRC bots.
    * Bot::Net::Mixin class for building mixins to add features to bots and
      servers.
    * Bot::Net::Object class to provide basic methods all over the place.
    * Bot::Net::Script class for command-line interface.
    * Bot::Net::Script::Bot class is broken (not fully refactored).
    * Bot::Net::Script::Help class to provide CLI help.
    * Bot::Net::Script::Net class to build scaffolding for Bot::Net apps.
    * Bot::Net::Script::Run class to run bots and servers.
    * Bot::Net::Script::Server class is broken (not fully refactored).
    * Bot::Net::Server class to build IRC servers (not fully refactored).
    * Bot::Net::Util class for miscellaneous stuff, currently contains a utility
      for parsing bot commands.
    * Comes with tests for dependencies, POD errors, and POD coverage.
    * Comes with a test application that is not yet complete.
