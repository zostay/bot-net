Revision history for Perl module Bot::Net

0.0.1 Sun Oct 7 20:07:47 2007
    * Initial release of Bot::Net.
    * This is a refactoring of a tool I used internally to build a nice bot net
      for synchronization. It still has some left overs from the old country
      that need to be brought into the new system fully, but the new system
      works and is superior to the old one.
    * Bot::Net class as the central singleton.
    * Bot::Net::Bot class as the main mixin implementation for building bots.
    * Bot::Net::Config class to load and find configuration files.

    * Bot::Net::Message class for encapsulating bot messages.

    * Bot::Net::Mixin class for building mixins to add features to bots and
      servers.
    * Bot::Net::Object class to provide basic methods all over the place.
    * Bot::Net::Script class for command-line interface.
    * Bot::Net::Script::Bot class is broken (not fully refactored).
    * Bot::Net::Script::Help class to provide CLI help.
    * Bot::Net::Script::Net class to build scaffolding for Bot::Net apps.
    * Bot::Net::Script::Run class to run bots and servers.
